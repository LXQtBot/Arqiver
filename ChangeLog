V0.3.2
---------
 * Added a workaround for the low performance of QMimeDatabase. Loading of heavy archives is much faster now.

V0.3.1
---------
 * Fixed archiving of files from different folders.
 * Fixed a mistake in choosing the archive name on compressing a folder.

V0.3.0
---------
 * Eliminated a rare cause of crash, when the file list contains "/" and "//" (with "application/x-archive", for example).
 * Removed QDesktopWidget::availableGeometry (could have been replaced by QGuiApplication::screens but wasn't needed).
 * Prevented drop into self.
 * Overwrite a Gzip archive if the overwrite prompt is accepted.
 * Always wait for a process (command) to be started before waiting for it to be finished.
 * Show the busy cursor while doing jobs.
 * Added file filtering.
 * To work around the inconsistent behavior of 7z on file removal, always ask the password.
 * Ask the password on replacing an encrypted file (inside a 7z archive).
 * Handled extraction of files with identical names inside 7z archives.
 * To prevent a file from being opened multiple times, ignore auto-repeat when Enter/Return is pressed inside the tree view.
 * Remove the temporary extracted files when they are replaced in the archive.
 * Enable selective extraction for 7z ("7z x archive -oDIR path1, path2,…").

V0.2.0
---------
 * Added Preferences dialog.
 * Customizable view icon size.
 * Polish translation by Marcin Mikołajczak (m4sk1n at GitHub).
 * Workaround for a KDE bug that, under some circumstances, doesn't let the application exit when its main window is closed.
 * Focus the view and its first item after updating it.
 * View/expand/collapse the current item with Enter/Return.
 * With tar/bsdtar and if the parent dir exists, change the parent dir name instead of extracting in a child dir.
 * A root archive file may mean a parent directory or a single file. Previously, it was supposed to be a parent directory and that caused single files not to be extracted with non-Gzip archives when they were present in the extraction directory.
 * If a file comes after its containing folder in the command line, bsdtar doesn't extract the folder. A workaround is added for this behavior.
 * Prevent tree collapse after extracting an rpm archive.
 * Don't update the tree unnecessarily.
 * Fixed a bug in removal of encrypted files inside 7z archives.

V0.1.0
---------
 * Arqiver is forked from lumina-archiver with lots of fixes, improvements and additions. It supports libarchive (bsdtar), gzip and 7z. With 7z, it also supports encryption (password protection).
 * Warn the user if a back-end in not installed.
 * Save the vertical space by making real use of the status bar.
 * Better support for multi-password 7z archives.
 * Added lock emblems to encrypted item icons.
 * Added symlink emblem.
 * Remember the window size and the last archiving filter.
 * Handle spaces in file names.
 * Item context menu.
 * Much faster listing with QHash, QPixmapCache and other methods.

V0.3.0
---------
 * Eliminated a rare cause of crash, when the file list contains "/" and "//" (with "application/x-archive", for example).
 * Removed QDesktopWidget::availableGeometry (could have been replaced by QGuiApplication::screens but wasn't needed).
 * Prevented drop into self.

V0.2.0
---------
 * Added Preferences dialog.
 * Customizable view icon size.
 * Polish translation by Marcin Mikołajczak (m4sk1n at GitHub).
 * Workaround for a KDE bug that, under some circumstances, doesn't let the application exit when its main window is closed.
 * Focus the view and its first item after updating it.
 * View/expand/collapse the current item with Enter/Return.
 * With tar/bsdtar and if the parent dir exists, change the parent dir name instead of extracting in a child dir.
 * A root archive file may mean a parent directory or a single file. Previously, it was supposed to be a parent directory and that caused single files not to be extracted with non-Gzip archives when they were present in the extraction directory.

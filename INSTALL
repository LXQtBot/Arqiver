************************************
*   Compilation And Installation   *
************************************

First install build dependencies. In Debian-based systems, they are:

 * g++ >= 5
 * qtbase5-dev
 * libqt5svg5-dev (for hard-coded SVG icons)
 * qttools5-dev-tools (for localization -- optional)

In Arch-based systems, the required package are:

 * gcc (or gcc-multilib for multilib systems)
 * qt5-base and qt5-x11extras (for Qt5)
 * qt5-svg (for hard-coded SVG icons)
 * qt5-tools (for localization -- optional)

In Red Hat based systems like Fedora:

 * gcc-c++
 * qt5-qtbase-devel
 * qt5-qtsvg-devel
 * qt5-qttools-devel

And, finally, in OpenSUSE:

 * gcc-c++
 * libqt5-qtbase-devel
 * libqt5-qtsvg-devel
 * libqt5-qttools-devel

In addition, you need to have libarchive (bsdtar), gzip and 7z installed because Arqiver is a front-end for them but they are not build dependencies.

With qmake
==========
Then, open a terminal inside this folder and issue the following commands:

	qmake && make
	sudo make install

Afterward, you could use this command to clean the source directory:

	make distclean

With cmake
==========
If you prefer cmake, use these commands instead:

	mkdir build && cd build
	cmake ..
	make
	sudo make install

**********************************
*   Translation (Localization)   *
**********************************

The file 'data/translations/arqiver.ts' can serve as the basis for translation. The translated file should be saved in the same directory as "arqiver_LN.ts", where "LN" is the abbreviation for the target language, like "de", "fr", etc.

If you have translated Arqiver's GUI into your language, please make a "Pull Request" (PR) at https://github.com/tsujan/Arqiver for your work to be merged into Arqiver!

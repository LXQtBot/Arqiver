# Arqiver

## Overview

Arqiver (by Pedram Pourang, a.k.a. Tsu Jan <tsujan2000@gmail.com>) is a simple and lightweight Qt archive manager as a front-end for libarchive (bsdtar), gzip and 7z. Not depending on any desktop environment, Arqiver

 * Can extract, create and edit archives supported by its back-ends;
 * Always extracts an archive containing multiple files into a separate folder and never overwrites existing files without the user's permission;
 * Can open archives also by drag-and-drop;
 * Enables users to view its listed items separately or drag and drop them into appropriate applications;
 * Allows updating of archives which are not opened as "read-only" after their individual files are viewed and modified;
 * Supports password protection with 7z; and
 * Has other features which can be found easily when it is actually used.

Please see [INSTALL](INSTALL) for instructions on compilation, installation and translation!

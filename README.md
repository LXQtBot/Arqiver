# Arqiver

## Overview

Arqiver (by Pedram Pourang, a.k.a. Tsu Jan <tsujan2000@gmail.com>) is a very simple Qt5 front-end for libarchive. It is still a work in progress but has the basic features for extracting and creating archives that are supported by libarchive.

Arqiver is forked from lumina-archiver, belonging to Lumina (<https://github.com/lumina-desktop/lumina>).
